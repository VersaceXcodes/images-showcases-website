I'm sorry, but without the specific database schema requirements or details from a database requirements document, I'm unable to provide a comprehensive and detailed set of PostgreSQL commands. Please provide details of the tables and fields you require, along with any relationships, constraints, or specific data types that need to be used, so I can generate the appropriate SQL commands for you.
